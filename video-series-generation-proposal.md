# Video Series Generation Feature Proposal

## Overview

This proposal outlines the implementation of a new feature that allows users to generate a complete video series from a single prompt. For example, a user could input "Create a video story about a kid named Billy and his adventures" and the system would automatically generate multiple connected video parts that tell a cohesive story.

## User Flow

1. User navigates to "Create Series" section of the application
2. User inputs a series concept/prompt (e.g., "Create a video story about a kid named Billy and his adventures")
3. User specifies number of episodes to generate (e.g., 3-10)
4. User optionally customizes parameters:
   - Episode duration target
   - Style/tone preferences
   - Character specifications
   - Visual theme
5. User submits request
6. System generates all episodes in background
7. User is notified when series generation is complete
8. User can view, edit, or publish individual episodes or the entire series

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Models

#### SeriesTemplate

```typescript
interface SeriesTemplate {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  prompt: string;
  episodeCount: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  settings: {
    episodeDuration: number; // in seconds
    style: string;
    characters: {
      name: string;
      description: string;
    }[];
    visualTheme: string;
    continuityRules: string;
  };
  episodes: VideoTemplate[]; // References to individual episode templates
}
```

### 2. Backend Components

#### Series Generation Service

- **Story Planning Module**: Develops overall narrative arc across episodes
  - Creates episode summaries ensuring narrative continuity
  - Defines character development across series
  - Designs plot progression with appropriate climax points

- **Episode Generation Module**: Converts each episode summary into detailed content
  - Integrates with existing video generation system
  - Ensures consistent character portrayal
  - Maintains plot continuity between episodes

- **Queue Management System**: Handles processing of potentially long-running generation tasks
  - Implements priority queue for fair resource allocation
  - Provides status tracking and notifications
  - Handles failure recovery

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Series Creation Form
- Prompt input field with examples
- Episode count selector
- Advanced settings collapsible section
- Generation progress indicator

#### Series Management Dashboard
- List view of all user's series
- Status indicators for generation progress
- Bulk actions for series management
- Preview thumbnails for episodes

#### Series Editor
- Tools to refine generated episodes
- Options to regenerate specific episodes
- Series metadata editor
- Publication tools

### 4. API Endpoints

```
POST /api/series
GET /api/series
GET /api/series/:id
PUT /api/series/:id
DELETE /api/series/:id
POST /api/series/:id/regenerate
POST /api/series/:id/episodes/:episodeId/regenerate
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Create data models for series templates
- Implement basic API endpoints
- Develop queue management system
- Build simple frontend for series creation

### Phase 2: Series Generation Logic
- Implement story planning module
- Connect to existing video generation system
- Create consistent character representation
- Develop narrative continuity rules

### Phase 3: User Experience Refinement
- Create series dashboard
- Implement editing capabilities
- Add progress tracking and notifications
- Develop tutorial content

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Add collaborative editing for teams
- Implement series templates/presets
- Create analytics for series performance
- Add AI-suggested improvements

## Technical Considerations

### Performance and Scalability
- Video generation is resource-intensive; implement efficient queuing
- Consider cloud resources allocation based on workload
- Implement caching strategies for generated content

### Quality Control
- Implement consistency checking between episodes
- Consider human-in-the-loop verification options
- Add feedback mechanisms to improve generation quality

### Privacy and Content Safety
- Apply existing content moderation to series generation
- Implement additional checks for narrative appropriateness
- Ensure proper content filtering for sensitive topics

## Cost Implications

- Increased API usage costs for AI generation
- Additional storage requirements for multiple videos
- Potentially increased processing time and computational resources

## Open Questions

1. How should narrative continuity be enforced while maintaining creative flexibility?
2. What is the optimal balance between generation speed and quality?
3. How can we efficiently handle resource allocation for users generating multiple series?
