# Vidspark ‚ú®

Vidspark is an innovative platform that automates the creation of engaging short-form videos using AI-generated story ideas, images, voiceovers, and music. Built with Next.js, Firebase, and Remotion (with AWS Lambda), Vidspark streamlines the creative process from content ideation to video rendering while offering a robust admin interface to manage content types and assets. üé•üöÄ

## Features
- **AI-Driven Narration ü§ñ:**  
  Generate creative, engaging story narrations using OpenAI.
- **Dynamic Image Generation üé®:**  
  Use Replicate to create high-quality, theme-based images with built‚Äëin NSFW filtering and prompt adjustments.
- **Voice Synthesis & Captioning üéô:**  
  Produce realistic voiceovers and automatic captions via ElevenLabs APIs.
- **Background Music Selection üéµ:**  
  Choose and update background music tracks with adjustable volume that is saved directly in the database.

  Render videos with Remotion orchestrated on AWS Lambda. A polling mechanism tracks real‚Äëtime rendering progress.
- **Content Type Management üìù:**  
  Manage content types through an admin panel featuring drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop reordering (using dnd‚Äëkit), inline editing with React Hook Form, and Zod validation.
- **Task Queues & Asset Syncing üîÑ:**  
  Process image, voice, and asset synchronization tasks with Firebase Cloud Tasks to ensure every asset is ready before video rendering.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Cloud Tasks), Node.js
- **Video Rendering:** Remotion with AWS Lambda
- **AI Services:** OpenAI, Replicate, ElevenLabs
- **Drag-and-Drop:** dnd‚Äëkit

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Content Creation Flow:
- Users select a content type and provide a story idea.
- AI services generate narration, images, voice, and background music.
- The admin interface allows managing and ordering content types.

### 2. Asset Processing:
- Firebase Cloud Tasks enqueue and process individual tasks (image generation, voice synthesis, captioning).
- A sync function monitors the status of each asset, updating the video status to ‚Äúassets: ready‚Äù when every asset is complete.

### 3. Video Rendering:
- Remotion renders the final video on AWS Lambda once all assets are ready.
- A polling mechanism tracks the render progress and updates the video‚Äôs status in real‚Äëtime.

## Usage
- **Content Creation & Editing:**  
  Navigate to the content creation section to generate story ideas and customize your video assets. The UI shows real‚Äëtime status for narration, image, voice, and music processing.
- **Admin Panel:**  
  Manage content types with drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop reordering and inline editing, powered by React Hook Form and Zod validation.
- **Video Rendering:**  
  Once assets are ready, the video is rendered using Remotion on AWS Lambda. Monitor progress and status updates throughout the rendering process.
- **Asset Syncing:**  
  Firebase Cloud Tasks handle individual tasks for image and voice processing, and a sync task ensures all assets are ready before final video processing.
